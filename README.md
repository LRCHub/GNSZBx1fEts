[00:04.60] Time has come to listen to the crying of their puppet souls
[00:34.10] 
[00:09.69] 君がそんなにもっと楽をして
[00:11.85] 行き詰まった未来と合図
[00:13.98] Words are strong, heart is dropped, scatter around and falls
[00:43.98] 
[00:18.49] 偽りのcontact-everything
[00:20.75] 誘い込んだ傷が混ざる
[00:23.04] 誰も忘れた悲しみが fall out
[00:32.04] 
[00:27.54] 偽名はただ凍る 希望のジレンマ
[00:32.14] 息削ぎ落とす行動も抑える
[00:36.54] そう解っている答えなど捨ててしまえ
[00:45.04] 
[00:45.48] Yeah get started breaking the row
[00:49.14] See how it spreads out. It's beyond full real-ization
[00:54.51] Yeah get started re-creating the world
[00:58.27] Take my hands till the end, feel this raw emotion
[01:22.77] 
[01:03.72] Bring it on down rock rock rock
[01:06.12] Shake it up up tap top top
[01:08.54] Cuz I know how to shout out my soul
[01:13.06] Bring it on down rock rock rock
[01:15.17] Shake it up up tap top top
[01:17.39] Cuz you know how to shout out your soul
[01:36.89] 
[01:24.08] I've got a feeling. You must let me go
[01:26.42] I wanna keep my faith forever
[01:29.12] Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls
[01:57.62] 
[01:33.18] I'm gonna fight them all to let you go
[01:35.58] I wanna seek my way to answer
[01:37.60] Words are alive, supporting us, connecting with the souls
[02:06.10] 
[01:42.20] You know what？ We look up to the sky, count on it.
[01:46.86] And halos in the clouds light me up. Then I awake
[01:52.33] In the heat, get fired up. You'll call my name
[02:15.33] 
[01:59.96] Yeah get started breaking the row
[02:03.72] See how it spreads out. It's beyond full real-ization
[02:09.15] Yeah get started re-creating the world
[02:12.85] Take my hands till the end, feel this raw emotion
[02:37.35] 
[02:18.28] Bring it on down rock rock rock
[02:20.87] Shake it up up tap top top
[02:23.06] Cuz I know how to shout out my soul
[02:27.57] Bring it on down rock rock rock
[02:29.96] Shake it up up tap top top
[02:32.23] Cuz you know how to shout out your soul
[02:51.73] 
[02:57.11] 偽名はただ凍る 希望のジレンマ
